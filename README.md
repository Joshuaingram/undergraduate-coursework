## Introduction

### New College of Florida
 I'm majoring in statistics and quantitative economics for my undergraduate degree at New College of Florida. For more information on the programs, see the links below:

This repository is where I keep any assignments for courses that require programming (as of Fall 2019). Considering the fact that this is all my college work and I get busy... the organization of these files may be a bit messy.

### Courses

- Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis
- Statistical Learning
- Linear Models
- Statistical Estimation and Inference
- Intermediate Python
- Statistical Inference for Data Science I (Grad)
- Data Munging and Exploratory Data Analysis (Grad)

## Descriptions

### Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis

This course focuses on methods for analyzing categorical response data. In contrast to continuous data, categorical data consist of observations classified into two or more categories. Traditional tools of statistical data analysis (such as linear regression) are not designed to handle such data and pose inappropriate assumptions. We will develop methods specifically designed for modeling categorical data and consider many applications in the social and biological sciences as well as in medical research, engineering and economics. The course will use the free statistical software R to carry out all statistical analysis and has two main parts. The first part will discuss statistical inference for parameters of categorical distributions and for measures of association arising in contingency tables. The longer second part will focus on statistical modeling of categorical response data via generalized linear models, with a heavy focus on logistic regression models.

### Statistical Learning

Statistical Learning discusses various statistical models for predictive and inferential purposes, with applications in marketing, finance, genetics and sports, among others. Particular models presented include multiple linear and logistic regression, decision trees and random forests. Emphasis will be on model validation, interpretation and diagnostics. The course will be accompanied by consistent coding practices while working with the R Statistical Software.

### Linear Models

Linear models represent the cornerstone family of statistical modeling approaches. This course will cover the main basics of linear models theory and applications, including such topics as: simple and multiple linear regression, statistical inference for model parameters, variable selection, model diagnostics, polynomial regression and generalized linear models. Moreover, this course will aim to solidify your programming skills. To achieve that, lectures will be accompanied by consistent coding practices while working with the R Statistical Software.

### Statistical Estimation and Inference

This course will introduce students to advanced mathematical and inferential procedures for a deeper understanding of statistical estimation and inference. Many topics from introductory statistics classes, such as random variables, the central limit theorem, statistical estimation and hypotheses testing will be revisited and put on a more rigorous mathematical footing. The course starts with a review of random variables (both discrete and continuous) and an extension to random vectors. Basic properties of random samples and statistics such as the sample mean and sample standard deviation are discussed, followed by a discussion of sampling distributions, including bootstrap and permutation approaches. Deriving and evaluating point estimators, with a focus on maximum likelihood and Bayes estimation is thoroughly covered, followed by principles of interval estimation and some discussion of hypothesis testing, including likelihood ratio tests. Although the course will use the R programming language, it will feel more theoretical because it explains the concepts and ideas behind the procedures underlying applied data analysis.
