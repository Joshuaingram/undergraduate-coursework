## Introduction

### New College of Florida
 I'm majoring in statistics, economics, and applied mathematics for my undergraduate degree at New College of Florida. For more information on the programs, see the links below:
 
 **Statistics Program:** https://www.ncf.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/division-of-natural-sciences/statistics/
 
 **Economics Program:** https://www.ncf.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/division-of-social-sciences/economics/

This repository is where I keep any assignments for courses that require programming (as of Fall 2019). Considering the fact that this is all my college work and I get busy... the organization of these files may be a bit messy.

### Courses

- Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis
- Statistical Learning
- Linear Models
- Statistical Estimation and Inference

## Descriptions

### Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis

This course focuses on methods for analyzing categorical response data. In contrast to continuous data, categorical data consist of observations classified into two or more categories. Traditional tools of statistical data analysis (such as linear regression) are not designed to handle such data and pose inappropriate assumptions. We will develop methods specifically designed for modeling categorical data and consider many applications in the social and biological sciences as well as in medical research, engineering and economics. The course will use the free statistical software R to carry out all statistical analysis and has two main parts. The first part will discuss statistical inference for parameters of categorical distributions and for measures of association arising in contingency tables. The longer second part will focus on statistical modeling of categorical response data via generalized linear models, with a heavy focus on logistic regression models.

### Statistical Learning

Statistical Learning discusses various statistical models for predictive and inferential purposes, with applications in marketing, finance, genetics and sports, among others. Particular models presented include multiple linear and logistic regression, decision trees and random forests. Emphasis will be on model validation, interpretation and diagnostics. The course will be accompanied by consistent coding practices while working with the R Statistical Software.

### Linear Models

Linear models represent the cornerstone family of statistical modeling approaches. This course will cover the main basics of linear models theory and applications, including such topics as: simple and multiple linear regression, statistical inference for model parameters, variable selection, model diagnostics, polynomial regression and generalized linear models. Moreover, this course will aim to solidify your programming skills. To achieve that, lectures will be accompanied by consistent coding practices while working with the R Statistical Software.

### Probability I and II

Probability I is the first module of a two modules sequence course in the probability theory and its applications. It focuses on the discrete random variables and distributions. One of the main goals of this course is to develop basic mathematical skill to work with models that incorporate uncertainty using a probabilistic framework. The course covers the material on counting methods and combinatorics, axioms of probability, independence, discrete random variables, Bayesâ€™ theorem, the most important discrete probability distributions, conditional probability, and laws of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

Probability II is the second module of a two modules sequence course in the probability theory and its applications. It focuses on the continuous random variables and distributions. The course covers the material on continuous random variables, the most important continuous probability distributions, moment generating functions, conditional probability, conditional expectations, multivariate distributions, Markov and Chebyshev inequalities, sample mean and statistical inference, laws of large numbers and the central limit theorem

### Topics in Statistical Inference for Data Science

Advanced material involving statistical inference and massive data sets. Topics vary and may include survival analysis, time series and prediction, risk analysis, decision theory, the theory of social networks, distributed software for statistical inference and advanced topics in machine learning.
