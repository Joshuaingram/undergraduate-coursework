# The Divergence Theorem

#### Theorem 16.9.1 - The Divergence Theorem

Let E be a simple solid region and let S be the boundary surface of E, given with positive (outward) orientation. Let **F** be a vector field whose component functions have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains E. Then 

$$
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \iiint_E div \: \mathbf{F} \: dV
$$
\
\

The Divergence Theorem states that, under the given conditions, the flux of **F** across the boundary surface of E is equal to the triple integral of the divergence of **F** over E.
